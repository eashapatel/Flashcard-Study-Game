# Java Arrays
- [[An **array** is a collection of variables of the same type]], referred to
  by a common name.
- In Java, arrays are objects, and must be created dynamically (at runtime).
1. [[What is the capital of Canada?:::The capital is Ottawa.]]
2. [[Which country is known as the Land of the Rising Sun?:::Japan.]]
3. [[What is the largest river in Africa?:::The largest river is the Nile River.]]
4. [[What is the tallest mountain in North America?:::The tallest mountain is Denali (also known as Mount McKinley).]]
5. [[Which continent is the driest inhabited continent on Earth?:::Australia.]]

11. [[Which continent is known as the "Roof of the World"?:::Asia.]]
12. [[What is the largest desert in Asia?:::The largest desert is the Gobi Desert.]]
## Declaring an Array
- [[General Form: type[] arrayName;]]
- ex: int[] myData;

- The above [[only creates a reference]] to an array object, but [[no array has
  actually been created yet]].

## Creating an Array (Instantiation)
- [[General form:  arrayName = new type[numberOfElements];]]
- ex: myData = new int[100];

13. [[Which country is the smallest in terms of land area?:::The smallest country is Vatican City.]]
14. [[What is the official language of Brazil?:::The official language is Portuguese.]]
15. [[Which city is located on two continents?:::Istanbul, Turkey. It is located on both Europe and Asia.]]
16. [[What is the largest island in the world?

:::The largest island is Greenland.]]
- Data types of the reference and array need to match.
- [[numberOfElements must be a positive Integer.]]
- [[Gotcha: Array size is not
  modifiable once instantiated.]]

20. [[What is the capital of Argentina?:::
